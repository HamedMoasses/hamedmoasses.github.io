            When the gas leaks, the sensors installed in different parts
            of the simulation environment (home) will sense this issue and will start sending
             messages through the ZigBee and WiFi standards and the windows will be opened for gas to escape.
            There is also a sensor-based intelligent network control system for energy control in this
            smart-home (which is not developed yet). Simulation results
            demonstrate energy consumption between various communication standards.
            The full details of the project will be uploaded to a YouTube tutorial video. Also, full documentation within codes are provided in current development on Github,

                            <p><strong><b>My M.Sc thesis aims to improve the energy consumption of heterogeneous IoT devices using an energy-aware clustering method. In a heterogeneous IoT cluster network, nodes (i.e., IoT devices) may have various energy profiles and energy sources.  One of the main challenges in the development and optimization of these types of clusters is battery-powered IoT devices, as they have limitations concerning their power consumption. This single constraint imposes several other constraints in regards to choices of routing protocols, Quality of Service (QoS), and mobility. In the past few years, many researchers, both in academia and industry, have proposed various methods for improving the energy efficiency of IoT networks. One of the well-known methods used to tackle this challenge is called the node clustering method. It involves grouping of nodes into several clusters and electing one or many cluster heads (CHs) for all the clusters. Several clustering algorithms proposed in the context of homogenous Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). However, due to the homogenous nature of nodes in such networks, most of these algorithms assumed that nodes had the same energy level and this is normally not true in IoT's diverse devices which in some cases we have nodes has been supplied with high capacity batteries or unlimited power. However, to utilize available clustering methods in the new paradigm of IoT networks, they need to be modified to consider the heterogeneity of nodes in IoT environments. In this work, we proposed a modification to an available clustering method, named Smart-BEEM, by redesigning the cluster head selection process. We introduced a statistical method that distributes energy consumption among highly energetic nodes and selects an appropriate communication medium to interact with other cluster heads. We evaluated our method using simulation and compared the results with well-known available clustering algorithms such as Smart-BEEM, BEEM, BEE, LEACH and HEED. On average, our proposed modification resulted in a 6.6% improvement in alive nodes, as well as a 3% improvement in residual energy among all the nodes in the network.

                            <p><strong><b>Clustering methods are the most common methods used to improve energy consumption and routing in wireless battery-based networks. One of the most popular of these networks is WSN, for which many clustering methods have been proposed. In the next generation, these networks became a subset of a more comprehensive concept called the Internet of Things. Due to the new parameters and nature of this type of network, the previous clustering methods need to be redesigned and changed so that they can work optimally in this type of network.
                            In this project, we simulate 5 well-known clustering algorithms in MATLAB environment and compare their performance. That was part of my master's thesis.

                            <p><strong><b>Nowadays, most major operating systems and computer networks, and even the Internet, which is the largest network in the world, use a protocol called the TCP / IP protocol. The limited bandwidth as well as the routing buffer limitations when network service requests increase, make network resources unresponsive, and if we don't have the right solution for network traffic management, the network becomes generally unstable. These conditions increase the length of the queue formed in the routers, and this leads to an excessive delay in the arrival of packets to the destination, and may even cause no packets to reach their desired destination. These are just some of the goal-setting shareware that you can use. Mostly in the field of control theory, the most important issue is sustainability as well as stabilization of dynamic systems, and considering the inherent ability and power of control science in the field of stabilization, the entry of this science into the field of traffic control in telecommunication networks is not unexpected. Since we can model telecommunications networks as a dynamic system, using control science in this area can solve many problems. So far, various methods have been proposed to prevent and control the phenomenon of overcrowding, most of which are well-known methods. The idea of using control theory concepts to solve the problem of overcrowding control has been around since the 1990s, and their goal is to use tools to analyze and design congestion controllers for networks in control engineering as There is a closed-loop system. In general, to solve the problem of Internet congestion control with a systemic approach and also to use control theory, we will be able to consider the closed-loop structure of the data transfer process in computer networks in such a way that a controller from the dynamic queue management family or Active queue management (AQM) is designed to be implemented in network routers, and the rest of the network is defined from the router's point of view, a control target system or plant.  <a href="https://github.com/HamedMoasses/Dynamic-Behavior-Internet">Code</a> - Base papers:<a href="  https://books.google.com/books?id=0iQlXJvCRe8C&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=Analyze+dynamic+behavior+in+controlling+internet+congestion+modeling&source=bl&ots=nsCCyVwK7L&sig=ACfU3U3J6s9SkEZQ75N1t9TgRGhtD6Q6FA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjI86eL3fzpAhVSURUIHVAxBZsQ6AEwBHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Analyze%20dynamic%20behavior%20in%20controlling%20internet%20congestion%20modeling&f=false"> 1</a><a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A13540&dswid=2668">, 2</a>

                            <p><strong><b>Metaheuristic algorithms are one of the most widely used algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence and have recently been emphasized in various scientific articles and sources. These algorithms are used to solve various problems. They are numerous and have their characteristics. Some of these algorithms are classified on the basis that they are inspired by nature or have an unnatural basis. Some are also categorized as based on a population of answers, or based solely on a search for the optimal answer to a problem. Among these algorithms, we can mention some of the following algorithms: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Bee Colony, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm(GA), Evolutionary Planning. These methods are an algorithmic framework that can be used for different optimization problems with small changes. Limitations are usually defined in terms of optimization. All available answers must be valid in these constraints, otherwise, the answers will not be justified. Optimization problems, in terms of the type of decision variables, can be divided into two groups of discrete problems and problems with continuous variables. In practice, a problem may be defined as a mixture that has discrete and continuous variables at the same time. When decision variables are broken in optimization problems, the problem of finding the optimal combination optimization answers is called.

      challenges I had in my M.Sc Thesis simulation project,
      I thought it would be the last time to use MATLAB for computer network simulation projects
    (specially IoT scenarios) and I thought migrating to an open source
    network simulator like NS3 would be much better since it makes me to
    gain new experience for future works specially for my PhD direction.
    since are under development by open source community and are free to use ! also after doing some research,
    I noticed NS3 is one of the best simulation tools for simulating IoT scenarios in 5G networks.
    I figured out MATLAB is a massive large and diverese language and tool for simulation and implementation. after study
    couple of papers (not too new and not too old!) I thought it would be a great excersie to warm up again
